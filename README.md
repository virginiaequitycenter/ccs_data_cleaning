# Charlottesville City Schools Data Sharing Cleaning Processes
This repository contains the processes that the Education Research Team at the Center for Community Partnerships undertakes to clean the Starr Hill Pathways student achievement data that comes to us from Charlottesville City Schools. 
In CCP's Research Practice Partnership with ACPS, a data sharing agreement has been reached such that we receive SOL, GPA, attendance, and demographic data for Starr Hill Pathways students.

## How to use this repository
Each folder contains the scripts used to clean the data related to the given data: one each for SOLs, Attendance, GPAs, and Demographics.

Both the raw data and the cleaned data are not included here to protect student privacy. Data is stored in a secure environment to ensure further protections.
